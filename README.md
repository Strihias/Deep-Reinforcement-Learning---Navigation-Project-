# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning---Navigation-Project-

This project is completed as a part of the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893 "Google's Homepage") from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). 

## Getting Started 
### Installation requirements

1. You first need to configure a Python 3.6 / PyTorch 0.4.0 environment. You can find an in depth guide in [Udacity space](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies)

2. Clone this project

3. Then you have to install the Unity environment as described in the [Getting Started](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/p1_navigation/README.md) section 
(The Unity ML-agant environment is already configured by Udacity)

4. Youc can download the environment from one of the links below:

* Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
* Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
* Windows (32-bit): [click here] (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
* Windows (64-bit): [click here] (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)

(For AWS) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not enabled a virtual screen), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

5. Finally, unzip the environment archive in the 'project's environment' directory and eventually adjust thr path to the UnityEnvironment in the code.
